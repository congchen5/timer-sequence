# timer-sequence
A website where you can define a sequence of timers and they will start one after another.

## Background
Recently, I began doing eye therapy as according to the book: [Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses](https://www.amazon.com/Improve-Vision-Without-Glasses-Contact/dp/0684814382).
As a child, my parents forced me to do these exercises. I didn't like them since it took 30 minutes each day. However, after a year of doing these eye exercises, my vision **did** improve.
I continued to to them until high school and college, when I stopped doing due to lack of time. Now that I'm working, I find that I have plenty of time each day. Thus, without excuses, I'm starting again.

The various techniques in the book require the use of a timer of various length over a period of 30 minutes.
For example:
- 1 minute of fast blinking
- 1 minute of slow blinking
- 1 minute of squeeze blinking
- 3 minute of pumping
- etc...

The sequence of timer is essentially (in minutes): 1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,5,2,2,2,5

This is tedious to constantly set a different timer length on the phone. Thus, I made this site, optimize for mobile web, which allows you to set the sequence and it'll have the next one lined up.

##How to use
Currently, the sequence is hardcoded in. You start at the first timer value (1 min). Once it's complete, you can stop and press the button for the next timer. You can go back and forth as you like.
